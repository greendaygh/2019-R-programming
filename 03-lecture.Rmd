# Lecture 3 - R Basics II

## Exercise 3-1

강의 자료의 연습문제 3-1

```{r}
mymat <- matrix(0, nrow=100, ncol=3) # 1
mymat[,1] <- 1:100 # 2
mymat[,2] <- seq(1,200,2) # 3
mymat[,3] <- seq(2,200,2) # 4
mymat[c(2,3,4,5),2] # 5
mymat-1 # 6
mysub <- mymat[,2] - mymat[,1] #7
sum(mysub) #8
sum(mysub^2) #8
```


This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. 그러면 이 사이트 한글은? 

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example: 3번째 강의 git

df
 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
